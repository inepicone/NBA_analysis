## Analysis of NBA players in the 2021/2022 season

This project will rely heavily in the use of API as data sources. Access to data is often provided through application programming interfaces (APIs), whether internal or external to the organization. It is very important to understand how to interact with APIs to collect data in our day to day work.

## The objectives of the project are:
  - Understanding how to query an API to create a dataset with Python and Pandas
  - Learning how to cleanup a dataset and generate new fields from calculated data
  - Storing the created dataset in a serialized manner
  - Generating statistics about the data
  - Visualizing data
  
## NBA information:
  
The National Basketball Association is the main basketball league in the United States of America. It currently features 30 teams from different cities, divided in 2 conferences (East and West) of 15 teams. Each team plays a total of 82 games during the regular season. After that, the 8 teams with better records from each conference are seeded in a playoff format, with the winner of each conference playing the finals to determine the eventual champion. NBA seasons usually play out between october of one year, to june of the next year, so for example the current season being played is called the 2021/2022 season.

As in most leagues in the world, the game is played 5 vs 5 players, with as many as 9 reserve players that can rotate with the starters as many times as the team wants. Games are played to 48 minutes, so the total amount of minutes of combined play time for any team in a single game with no added time is 240 minutes. If the score is tied at the end of the 48 minutes, 5 minutes of extra time are played, this continues until a winner is decided.

Even though they can play multiple positions, players are usually classified according to the following positions:

- Guards
    - Point Guards
    - Shooting Guards
- Forwards
    - Small Forwards
    - Power Forwards
- Centers

We will mainly focus on the three main positions: Guards/Forwards/Centers
