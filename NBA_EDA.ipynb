        "The National Basketball Association is the main basketball league in the United States of America. It currently features 30 teams from different cities, divided in 2 conferences (East and West) of 15 teams. Each team plays a total of 82 games during the regular season. After that, the 8 teams with better records from each conference are seeded in a playoff format, with the winner of each conference playing the finals to determine the eventual champion. NBA seasons usually play out between october of one year, to june of the next year, so for example the current season being played is called the 2021/2022 season.\n",

Games are played to 48 minutes, so the total amount of minutes of combined play time for any team in a single game with no added time is 240 minutes. If the score is tied at the end of the 48 minutes, 5 minutes of extra time are played, this continues until a winner is decided.\n",

        "When NBA players enter the league, they have low value salaries during what is called their \"rookie contract\". This means that it doesn't matter how well the player performs, they can't have large salaries. This can distort our understanding of how much teams value each skill, as a player could score 50 points a game and still earn just a couple of millions. So, lets now plot points, assists and rebounding vs salary, but only for players that have more than 4 years of experience (the typical length of a rookie contract)"
